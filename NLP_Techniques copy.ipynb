iPhone X Q This year launched end lineup XS XS Max Q Obviously resulted pronounced ASP growth Q  obviously tougher compare Q So I think it’s important mind look revenue guidance provided The second point needs kept mind fact life dealt number years now fact I look currencies world virtually foreign currency depreciated US dollar  months And look impact foreign exchange revenue December quarter we’re looking BPS headwinds translates given size business B headwind revenue The point I think it’s important mind Tim talked this launching weeks we’ve launched unprecedented number new products They’re ramping right now The ramps going fairly well obviously uncertainty supplydemand balance products And finally point we’ve taken account Tim’s talked terms level uncertainty macroeconomic level emerging markets clearly consumer confidence high  months ago So account that’s got range Q  Shannon S Cross Okay Thank you And then I want talk little bit pullback terms guidance unit perspective I understand don’t want guidance  days short period time fluctuate kind qualitative commentary think you’ll able provide Because it’s obviously investors spent years going P times Q So think expect sort going manage process through I know it’s job forecast but A  Luca Maestri Yes Let walk rationale we’ve I’ll talk qualitative commentary mentioning As I said right objective great products provide best customer experience customer satisfied engaged loyal ecosystem When look financial performance recent years years example number units sold quarter necessarily representative underlying strength business If look revenue given years look net income years look stock price years there’s correlation units sold given period As know well addition product ranges major product categories wider time therefore unit sale relevant point compared past got wider sales price dispersion unit sale se relevant As I know you’re aware way competitors smartphones tablets computers provide quarterly unit

look looking data sales data XS XS Max there’s obvious evidence data I it Q  Mike J Olson Got it mentioned record levels components services business As look forward growth services maintain close recent pace components services you’re particularly excited drive strongest drivers And maybe offshoot that like news flow augmented reality slowed little bit recent months Is potentially materially contributor services near future Thanks A  Luca Maestri Mike said September quarter set new records many services categories right Apple Music cloud services App Store AppleCare Apple Pay exponential trajectory right now When look services business think fact large growing installed base The installed base major product categories alltime high growing quarters opportunity monetize services

future opportunities services space A  Timothy Donald Cook Mike terms question AR I different view one Just year ago practically year ago came ARKit  Six months came  We recently came ARKit  The number things growing significantly The number developers something case working things I’ve seen growing tremendously There’s lot number categories I’m seeing gaming shopping I China weeks ago saw AR art sense art exhibit I Berlin week saw historical educational kind sense I’m seeing sort I now I think early days it’ll getting better better I’m happy things moment Q  Kathryn Lynn Huberty Tim given current trade negotiations broader geopolitical risk plans consider diversifying supply chain And that sort forced think significant impact business profitability A  Timothy Donald Cook Katy look products created manufacturing they’re manufactured everywhere We significant content US market We content Japan Korea countries great content China well hands products The vast majority RD United

reason things developed way I think it’s great countries citizens countries involved that And I’m mindset I feel optimistic positive discussions going fruitful These relationships trade relationships big complex clearly need level focus level updating modernization And I’m optimistic countries US China US Europe forth work things work benefit everyone Q  Kathryn Lynn Huberty That’s helpful color And Luca followup NAND prices fell significantly September quarter Why aren’t seeing flow margin expansion overall company A  Luca Maestri You’re referring guidance provided Q I imagine Q  Kathryn Lynn Huberty Yes A  Luca Maestri Let puts takes Katy You’re correct We going getting benefits commodities general memory particular Memory sequential basis BPS favorable going December quarter And obviously we’re going benefiting leverage typical seasonality December quarter On hand I mentioned before currencies weakened US dollar impact expect gross margin level foreign exchange BPS headwind sequentially And course point cycle higher cost structures because I said we’ve launched new products weeks So puts takes leverage commodity savings FX new products side Q  Jim Suva A question Tim question Luca I’ll ask time decide wants second But operationally Tim I think company disadvantage relative India giving items produced vs shipped vs taxed vs installed ability stores So help address that Is India going potentially big area I think got  market share sounded like things softer there And Luca probably lot pushback giving iPhone unit data It sounds like you’re going revenue data I heard correctly people fear means iPhone units going start going negative yovery it’s easier talk great things details things aren’t great So thank much gentlemen A  Timothy Donald Cook Okay I’ll start India We’ve great productive discussions Indian government I fully expect point agree allow bring stores country We’ve discussions them discussions going well As point out import duties product categories we’re in In cases compound area we’re giving lots feedback on We manufacture entry iPhones India project gone well I big believer India I bullish country people ability there The currency weakness challenge there tell looking currency trends I view speed bumps long journey though And long term I think very strong there There’s huge number people middle class The government focused reform major way bold moves And I applaud I can’t wait future there A  Luca Maestri And Jim let question units First all Tim said approach guidance providing guidance doesn’t change all We continue provide metrics providing before Company Name Apple Market Cap TRI Bloomberg Estimates  EPS Company Ticker AAPL US Current PX  Current Quarter  Date  YTD Change + Current Year  Event Description Q

significant level this starting December quarter time we’re going providing information revenue cost sales gross margins products services And time we’re going provide gross margin information services business believe important metric investors follow Given rationale believe providing unit sales particularly relevant company point I reassure objective grow unit sales product category have But I said earlier unit sale relevant today past To example unit sales iPhone end line strong September quarter that’s important we’re attracting customers recent technologies features innovation bring lineup don’t necessarily number reported And therefore will I said we’ll provide qualitative commentary important relevant But end day decisions financial standpoint try optimize revenue gross margin dollars think focus best investors A  Timothy Donald Cook Jim let add couple things color Our installed base growing double digit that’s probably significant metric ecosystem point view

fact know lose leverage December quarter March quarter The foreign exchange headwind sequential basis BPS Obviously negative And said started experience level cost pressure memory side particularly NAND DRAM To offset that actually better that good cost performance commodities And fact Services mix increases year course helping given profile gross margin Services So answers question Q As June

The Services revenue keeps growing course profit contribution growing And we’ve time I think seen maybe little aggressive Apple historically pricing certain key technologies let’s them maybe want penetrate market with I wonder comment little bit strategy terms usage extra profit contribution Services business intend apply rest business Thank you A  Timothy Donald Cook The way think pricing come price think good value product we’re delivering hardware Services side And that’s think it We’re thinking taking profits subsidize viceversa Q  Steven M Milunovich Could comment opportunity wearables The watch people consider disappointing good quarter ironically competition fading market right now The AirPods course well Do wearables A expanding time broader product line B increasingly independent iPhone longer term A  Timothy Donald Cook We seen watch key product category launched it We took time right we’ve better Series  offering And we’re proud growth business The watch units doubled markets phenomenal growth particularly nonholiday quarter And couldn’t satisfied it As people begin combine watch revenues revenues AirPods know quarter shipments AirPods It’s ramping mode

long AirPods three months feel great it Where go I wouldn’t want comment that great pipeline here And I think terms competition falling forth watch area hard It essence engineering point view similar

 Q  Steven M Milunovich And – mentioned  Research survey They couple findings interesting One nineyear low iPhone purchase intent cycle And declining retention rate US  Any comment you’re concerned A  Timothy Donald Cook I glanced it I haven’t time study it But general seeing we’re seeing believe pause purchases iPhone believe earlier frequent reports future iPhones And clearly going on what’s data I don’t know seeing transparency Q  AM Sacconaghi Jr I well First Tim I’m wondering comment recent decision rationale withholding royalty payments Qualcomm And specifically I wonder believe risk Qualcomm detrimental response withholding modem chip sales potentially getting injunction iPhones select geographies world And I’d like understand perspective real risk degree And Apple potentially risks advance arguably significant largest product launch history A  Timothy Donald Cook Anyone standardsessential patent responsibility offer like called FRAND terms FRAND stands fair reasonable nondiscriminatory terms That’s price business terms Qualcomm offer Apple And I don’t believe – I don’t believe going decide enjoin iPhone based that I think there’s plenty case law subject shall see In terms we’re withholding royalties can’t pay there’s dispute amount You don’t know pay And think owe amount think owe different amount hasn’t meeting minds there And point need courts decide that Unless able to time settle amount right we’re depending courts that And thinking The reason we’re pursuing Qualcomm’s trying charge Apple percentage total iPhone value And great work standardsessential patents it’s small iPhone is It’s – display Touch ID gazillion innovations Apple done And don’t think that’s right we’re taking principled stand it And strongly believe we’re right I’m sure believe are And that’s courts for And we’ll let that Q  AM Sacconaghi Jr I wondering I follow little bit iPhone demand If I try adjust drawdown inventory extra week quarter I think sequentially iPhones declined  I adjustments And that’s actually bit lower normal seasonality Q Q typically closer  I understand comments China comparison  points easier quarter relative quarter And growth rate improved marginally I think adjust extra week And final comment pause iPhones So I’m wondering maybe elaborate on sequential calculation growth rate Q attributable pause And characterize think upgrade rates doing broadly geography help better understand happening competitive dynamics play that again contributing pause sequential decline I referenced Thank you A  Timothy Donald Cook There lot questions there Let color I it In quarter reduced channel inventory mm units And look yovery basis primarily look unit point view seasonality embedded that grew sellthrough yovery basis Last

world quarter broadening scope And course similar weve past years launched new services Were looking launch new services going forward believe provide great value users were excited L opportunities us A N I F I think youre referring deceleration growth rate weve seen December quarter I think youre referring growth reported September I think important point I need make I think its helpful asked question portion deceleration truly reclassiﬁcation amortization free services weve connection adoption new revenue recognition standard And explained  days ago amortization free services past reported Products gets reported Services The reclassiﬁcation actually dilutive growth rate amortization free services relatively stable number gets applied growing base reclassiﬁcation reduces growth rate versus previous classiﬁcation This factor represents roughly onethird deceleration youve seen We talked  growth September quarter With reclassiﬁcation growth rate  explains deceleration There are I say factors explain diﬀerence  t  The ﬁrst foreign exchange plays role Roughly  Services p business outside United States And know US dollar appreciated recent months And general tend reprice services foreign exchange r c frequent basis s n The second factor wellknown issue App Store China The App Store China large business us We believe issue approval new game r T titles temporary nature clearly aﬀecting business right now g r And thirdly seen level deceleration AppleCare e very strong growth ﬁscal  were starting lap b increase distribution coverage place recently channel ﬁll m Apple

envelope little bit far bring t future p r c A  Timothy Donald Cook BIO  GO s Steve its Tim If look past year priced iPhone XS n US priced iPhone X year ago The iPhone XS Max new  XS And priced XR right middle r T entry iPhone  entry iPhone  Plus priced So theres actually pretty small diﬀerence United States compared year g r e However foreign exchange issue Luca spoke diﬀerence b ampliﬁed diﬀerence international markets particular emerging markets tended signiﬁcantly versus dollar And m January locations products essentially absorb o foreign currency compared year close o right local price year ago So yes I think price factor I think l FX piece B And secondly markets I talked prepared remarks subsidy probably bigger issues developed markets I mentioned Japan country subsidy gone away period time youre customer purchase S  cases Page  Company Name Apple Inc Company Ticker AAPL US Equity Date   paid  it unbundled world its obviously that And working weve got number actions address that including tradein installment payments I mentioned well Q  Steven Milunovich BIO  GO I know youre giving units going forward said qualitative L A comments I wondering comment particularly ASP year N overyear basis I F A  Luca Maestri BIO  GO Steve mention quarter diﬀerent timing phone launches aﬀect yearoveryear compares If remember models XS XS Max shipped September quarter placed channel ﬁll initial sales quarter year iPhone X shipped Q December quarter placed channel ﬁll initial sales December quarter So knew create diﬃcult compare Q  essentially happened It pretty line

Antonio M Sacconaghi BIO  GO Yes thank you I Luca Tim Luca looks like midpoint r T Q revenue guidance implies steepest Q Q sequential decline iPhone revenues history It implies yearoveryear deceleration iPhone revenues And g Im wondering comment thats conservatism youre r entering quarter high level channel inventory maybe comment e explicitly that actually think macroeconomic conditions getting b worse m o A  Luca Maestri BIO  GO o Yes questions there The ﬁrst question conservatism As l B do provide range its range believe were going fall within Weve pretty December quarter We didnt miss years years thats idea There isnt speciﬁc level conservatism We believe range were going fall within Page  Company Name Apple Inc Company Ticker AAPL US Equity Date  On channel inventory know historical pattern iPhone channel inventory typically increase inventory Q decrease Q think year similar And weve exited December quarter levels inventory comfortable with So leaves reality iPhone performance Q revenue standpoint minus  And expected key factors Tim mentioned L aﬀecting iPhone performance Q eﬀect Q starting A strong US dollar environment On yearoveryear basis negative impact N I currency going  billion thats bit  points versus F years revenue obviously plays role And macroeconomic environment particularly emerging markets continue there On positive side expect continue grow revenue nicely rest business iPhone Q  Antonio M Sacconaghi BIO  GO Okay thank you Tim September event Lisa Jackson Apple VP stated company needed design products long possible And Apple clearly helping battery replacement program iOS working older range products et cetera But I guess question doesnt mean replacement upgrade cycles iPhones continue extend going forward thats objectives And maybe end maybe help understand t iPhones average replacement cycle today changed p   years And again wouldnt expect elongate time r given aforementioned things Thank you c s n A  Timothy Donald Cook BIO  GO We design products long possible Some people hold r T life product people trade in phone redistributed else doesnt necessarily follow leads g other r e b The upgrade cycle extended Theres doubt that Weve said times I m think upgrades quarter anticipated reasons mentioned So goes future I o dont know Im convinced making great product high quality best o thing customer work user thats way look it l B A  Nancy Paxton BIO  GO Thank you Toni Could question please Operator Page  Company Name Apple Inc Company Ticker AAPL US Equity Date  The question come Shannon Cross Cross Research Q  Shannon S Cross BIO  GO Thank much I wanted ask trajectory Services gross margin  basis points appears year year You talked little bit sequential But whats driving improvement volatile year depending quarters mix Just color start L A forecast this Thank you N I F A  Luca Maestri BIO  GO Yes Shannon I think youve seen Services gross margins increased yearover year basis signiﬁcant amount Let start sequential I think its probably relevant us Sequentially increased  basis points Its business growing nicely good support scale Some services scaling quickly tend expand gross margins there And favorable mix As probably know broad portfolio services Some tend accretive average gross margin services way account them For example know App Store book revenue net basis gross margins tend accretive But services successful average Services business And depending separate businesses marketplace were going seeing level movement going forward Services margins But youve seen  months theyve gone nicely  basis points t p sequentially theyve gone  basis points But I wouldnt draw necessarily conclusion Services gross margin going time We report r c course end quarter its important mind its broad s portfolio diﬀerent gross margin proﬁles portfolio n It important grow gross margin dollars And times grow services r T level gross margins average long good customer long generate gross margin dollars were going g pleased r e b Q  Shannon S Cross BIO  GO m Okay thank you And then Tim talk bit video Youve signed myriad deals There announcement TV app directly Samsung o comes youll multiplatform Im curious view o opportunity video And I guess assuming leverage costs youve l B already accretive margin I think A  Timothy Donald Cook BIO  GO Yeah Shannon huge changes customer behavior taking place now think accelerate year goes breakdown cable bundle Page  Company Name Apple Inc Company Ticker AAPL US Equity Date  thats talked years I think likely place faster pace year

extend conversation point Weve hired great people I super conﬁdence in theyre working hard And well later A  Nancy Paxton BIO  GO Thank you Shannon Could question please Operator t p The question come Walter Piecyk BTIG r c Q  Walter Piecyk BIO  GO s n Great thanks I question free services Can math works that Is free services noncash revenue thats getting booked r Services revenue cost costs come Products Can T run current state versus accounting g before r e A  Luca Maestri BIO  GO b In essence sell product certain price assumption We m estimate value associated providing free services In case its o providing Maps services providing Siri providing free iCloud customers o purchase product calculate estimated value That value gets deferred l gets amortized estimated period time deliver free services B In past deferral subsequent amortization reported Products Now connection new revenue recognition standard reclassifying essentially amortization Products revenue Services revenue So total revenue changed We report estimated value Services category We Page  Company Name Apple Inc Company Ticker AAPL US Equity Date  reclassify cost incur provide services So gross margin rate free services clearly signiﬁcantly dilutive overall Services margin I hope Ive helped that Q  Walter Piecyk BIO  GO So its Services gross margin got it And second question think growth Services selling existing paid subscription L A customers its  million going  billion If talk high level N far look growth going forward – mix terms I F selling existing users getting new users maybe individual services biggest growth opportunity Thank you A  Luca Maestri BIO  GO As I said essentially services installed base ﬁrst driver growing installed base The installed base grown nicely years Weve added

services revenue  talked previously Q  Kathryn Lynn Huberty And doesn’t look like threat trade war China slowed business In fact growth accelerated But anecdotally business recent weeks suggest having impact demand actions Apple taking company preempt risk tariffs going forward A  Timothy Donald Cook Yeah I think view China US unavoidable mutuality China wins US wins US wins China wins world wins

environment particularly we’re dealing BPS impact memory pricing environment we’re working through Q  Amit Daryanani Got it And I follow up Tim you’ve fairly vocal I think talking need better privacy protection wellcrafted regulation time Could maybe help understand Apple protect consumer data And ongoing debate data protection translate positive Apple time A  Timothy Donald Cook We protect encrypting it bulk information significant information device user control it We collect overall do Because look model convince buy iPhone iPad we’ll little bit money You’re product And that’s look that Company Name Apple Market Cap  Bloomberg Estimates  EPS Company Ticker AAPL US Current PX  Current Quarter  Date  YTD Change  Current Year  Event Description Q  Earnings Call YTD Change

lot user agreements forth And we’ve viewed role sort things simple possible user provide level privacy security And that’s look it Q  Steven Milunovich Luca talk bit capital allocation The dividend increase  relatively low relative done thinking stock price attractive here And said execute buyback fast pace Can timeframe B debt think terms net cash zero A  Luca Maestri Yes Let’s start dividend We’re increasing  This largest increase we’ve we’ve reintroduced dividend August  So think it’s meaningful increase investors value income Obviously come capital allocation decisions obviously mind opportunity MA activities ongoing basis But comes dividends buyback view variety reasons lot value stock We believe stock undervalued bias buyback So dividend large component capital return we’re going returning B year investors dividends believe given valuation stock think continue buyback primarily We giving end date program time very large try execute it As you’ve seen track record years fast pace want efficiently We want sure buy stock right time And mind B repurchases March quarter We update activities end quarter  months actually talk update entire program So able track progress  days Q  Steven Milunovich Thank you And Tim talk bit healthcare opportunity Is merely selling watches time think broadly it Is services play You’re things employees Could potentially broaden out How think opportunity there A  Timothy Donald Cook We think broadly tell bit things we’ve going ResearchKit CareKit recently health records I referenced initial comments came getting significantly engaged Apple Watch sort pulling strings speak And heart study going currently I don’t want away But it’s area great think big difference in And it’s major strategic thrust ours Q  Brian J White Yes Tim I

getting traction there Services extremely well And catalysts I’m pleased results able quarter Q  Wamsi Mohan Tim comment price elasticity demand high end iPhones line expectations Do preference unit growth vs ASP growth comes maximizing gross profit dollar growth And I followup Luca please A  Timothy Donald Cook We price value we’re delivering iPhone X innovative product market And I’ve said times sort jampacked technologies set smartphone decade And that’s priced it We surprised somewhat period time iPhone X winds selling popular week time launch And that’s I think powerful point And it’s number China powerful point And obviously point technologies lower price points there’s probably unit demand But way think trying price reasonable price value deliver I feel that Q  Wamsi Mohan Thank you Tim And Luca gross margins robust despite headwinds absorbed commodities quantified frankly FX hedges limiting somewhat FX upside lot companies seeing So you one expect turn tailwinds And turn tailwinds consider reinvesting pricing think flowing line A  Luca Maestri Well Wamsi I think let start right now I think you’re right I think we’ve able navigate difficult foreign exchange environment number years now know hedging program dollar weakened bit recent months week it’s actually started turn way again we’ve got hedging program works ways And memory front feel NAND we’re going turning corner soon For DRAM think near peak possibly end year And provide level stability As I said earlier year I think experiencing total difficult cost environment hopefully turn positive us At time it’s difficult indication going happen future product cycle different know don’t provide guidance past current quarter There elements understand tend manage course cycle For example cost structures able manage year But elements entirely control like foreign exchange And mix products services sell customers impact overall gross margin Our primary consideration maximizing gross margin dollars approach example pricing decisions Q  Jim Suva And I’ll ask actually questions time Tim Luca Tim strategically talk investors say oh iPhone market saturated There’s room growth Yet analysis kind emerging markets like India growth When think India markets kind believe markets higher normalized market share developing countries time And Company Name Apple Market Cap  Bloomberg Estimates  EPS Company Ticker AAPL US Current PX  Current Quarter  Date  YTD Change  Current Year  Event Description Q  Earnings Call YTD Change  Bloomberg Estimates  Sales Current Quarter  Page  Current Year  talk little bit efforts doing And then Luca question you gross margin When think component prices start stabilize seeing Apple services successful accretive margins start look potential margin gross margin upside components stabilize Thank you gentlemen A  Timothy Donald Cook Yeah Jim thanks question In terms – let address smartphone market bit I’ll mention iPhone In terms market general look year data point market B feature phones sold world And sold emerging markets them them And believe time phone sold smartphone And feature phones sold that’s pretty big opportunity In terms iPhone itself sell phones course year market share globally low compared – sales low compared market smartphones And task convince people currently – type phone switch taking care people iPhone choose – elect buy phone buy iPhone And we’ve spent bit time that guess I think India India largest smartphone market world There’s obviously huge opportunities us extremely low share market overall And we’re putting lot energy working carriers market they’re investing enormously LTE networks And infrastructure come ways began lot energy leadership forth And I think – I don’t buy view market’s saturated I don’t market point view – certainly iPhone point view I think smartphone market sort like best market consumer product company history world – that’s I feel it It’s terrific market we’re happy it A  Luca Maestri Jim gross margin side I think I’ll repeat I said earlier you’re right Our services business I’ve said past accretive company margins And able grow services business provide positive tailwind At time services portfolio have services different levels profitability need account mix services we’re going selling At macro level twothirds company outside United States weak dollar positive gross margins strong dollar it’s years bit headwind company We try stable hedging program And general look process innovate products typically launch new product product tends higher cost structure product replaces And need work time launch new product pretty good track record history taking cost structures time So need balance different elements I think we’ve pretty remarkable job years managing different variables coming level gross margins think good investors certainly plan continue manage way But it’s difficult prediction gross margins going months  months now This

I’m curious You raised price iPhone  Plus that What seeing customers saying terms willingness pay up A  Luca Maestri Shannon I looking back Since June  we’re talking  years ago dollar strengthened  basket currencies business And obviously difficult situation us I’ve mentioned foreign exchange significant headwind us revenue level gross margin level In emerging markets it’s incredible The level products continues phenomenal The brand continues aspirational There people afford products world The middle class growing places like China India Brazil certainly strong dollar doesn’t help us And therefore pricing decisions need careful We want optimal balance units revenue margin difficult dollar appreciates Q  Brian J White Luca I’m wondering talk little bit gross margins Sales obviously

we’re seeing point view Some folks tried link US situation year they’re different In case US law US supported us clear In case China law clear there And like US changed law here we’d abide cases

traditional manner Services business vs installed base growing A  Luca Maestri Our Services business broad We’ve got multiple categories Services business it’s difficult talk ARPU general It doesn’t lot sense The reason acceleration multiple factors One very important fact App Store largest Services categories seeing increasingly larger paying accounts On yovery basis number accounts actually transacting paying App Store growing very well It happening variety reasons One them example fact making easier customers pay App Store Outside United States markets form payment accepted We making easier time We launched Alipay example China December quarter That obviously helped lot growth number paid accounts And continue bring forms payment App Store world That’s big reason that The reason number paying accounts growing fact quality quantity content continues improve And there’s ways experiencing games entertainment apps store We businesses like Apple Music streaming service growing fast started couple years ago getting lot new subscribers there Our iCloud storage business continues grow very fast So it’s multiple services The number people transacting stores continues grow In

end Perhaps switchers China maybe drove growth China terms market share But sort thinking went guidance December quarter Are seeing strong demand low end obviously expected benefit X high end I’m trying understand broader lineup you’ve prior years A  Timothy D Cook Yes In terms saw Q probably tell ASP good success I say different iPhones And we’ve tried hard iPhone affordable possible people want iPhone limited budget And we’ve got iPhones great market And we’ve got new iPhones people look decide want And time we’ve position we’ve new iPhones like end line And it’s time we’ve staggered

actually declining Music streaming service addition download business business growing again And helps growth rate entire Services business ICloud service continues grow strong double digits that’s helping So size Fortune  company We set goal double FY trajectory actually positive Q  Steven Milunovich I wanted try push little bit mix Could comment  Plus outsold  quarter There data suggests that And  Research survey you’re alluding finds  days buying iPhone  planning buying X Could comment expectations terms mix going forward And won’t that comment bit thinking terms pushing price elasticity I think couple years ago would’ve imagined selling phone price obviously you’re pretty confident it A  Timothy D Cook Obviously I’m going talk mix That’s we’ve past If look   Plus launched them instantly selling products If look  Plus particular provide little color there  Plus period time measure date gotten fastest start Plus model That bit surprise positive surprise obviously And we’ll happens next As I’ve mentioned before we’ve products it’s today customers sort look I’m sure there’s people wanted deciding one And we’ll happens there But terms price elasticity I think it’s important remember large number people pay phone month And US tends focus call look US carriers I think buy iPhone X  month And think that that’s coffees week It’s let’s coffee day nice coffee places The thing mind people trading current iPhone iPhone And residual value iPhone tends highest industry people pick   iPhone reduces monthly payment less And obviously carriers promotional things going on And I think it’s important try place context In terms way price price sort value we’re providing We’re trying charge highest price like that We’re trying price we’re delivering And iPhone X lot great new technologies leading industry fabulous product can’t wait people start getting hands Q  Steven Milunovich And I wanted ask Street historically little skeptical continued innovation you’ve suggested go Historically weren’t large screens weren’t OLED Now though you’re leading AR you’re leading face ID allin year ago guys suggested kind reminiscent aggressive Apple Is possible going forward accelerate share gains Android you’re stronger competitive position A  Timothy D Cook I think Steve we’ve competitive position And I probably maybe different view folks you’re quoting There’s doubting Thomases there And I’ve hearing  years I’ve suspect I’ll hear I retire right So I don’t listen much There’s lots fantastic people they’re unbelievable things And yes I view AR profound Not today app you’ll App Store today be be I think it’s profound I think Apple unique position lead area Company Name Apple Market Cap  Bloomberg Estimates  EPS Company Ticker AAPL US Current PX  Current Quarter  Date  YTD Change + Current Year  Event Description Q  Earnings Call YTD Change + Bloomberg Estimates  Sales Current Quarter  Page  Current Year  Q  Antonio M Sacconaghi Just following little bit question Tim You talked bit providing lot value Apple sets prices according value And I think given uniqueness product iPhone X particular makes lot sense I guess question given uniqueness value marketplace shouldn’t – we shouldn’t expect gross margins improve cycle vs previous ones And talk little bit think pricing context gross margin And I followup please A  Luca Maestri Toni I’ll one When – said price products value deliver We said time launch new products cost structures new products tend higher products replace It’s inevitable We adding new technologies new features cost structures up We good track record taking cost structures life cycle product able bring down There lot elements gross margin line good control elements don’t control Take example foreign exchange significant headwind company years now Also mix products sell market tends change time impact overall gross margin company There situations commodities markets good shape There situations commodity markets bit balance We case right memory pricing headwind time being So there’s puts takes The fact Services business growing positive Services margins tend accretive company margins So there’s puts takes We tend think maximizing gross margin dollars think that’s important thing investors end day When look track record years I think we’ve good balance unit grow gross margins revenue continue forward Q  Antonio M Sacconaghi Okay Thank that And I wanted revisit notion supply demand I realize it’s early can’t predictions I think common investor question is iPhone X available sale It quickly pushed availability levels unprecedented levels vs history And I think significant question is initial pushout function uniquely strong demand vs history pushout availability function weaker supply vs history So it’d helpful You past commented hour orders mm plus iPhone   Plus You talked targeting think reach supplydemand balance So it’d helpful provide context terms know initial orders supplies vs history help investors try better understand little data points they’re seeing terms availability device Thank you A  Timothy D Cook The truth don’t know We’ve best estimate guidance guidance bullish And so feel great product lineup We sold units minutes ago And we’ll things go Until customers ability demo support I think kind mix discussion estimating And best estimates in grantedly we’ve before So there’s comparison here iPhones staggered launch So we’re going learn something Q  Jim Suva And I’ll ask original question followup time they’re slightly different topics But you’d mentioned great success India I believe Tim prepared comments mentioned I think India doubled yovery Based market analysis looks like Apple’s relatively small sliver pie there So Tim successful India Is manufacturing footprint there Is partners Is physical stores Is lower price points Is bandwidth caught countries think that And followup question ARVR income statement Are hoping hardware sales services apps excitement monetize Company Name Apple Market Cap  Bloomberg Estimates  EPS Company Ticker AAPL US Current PX  Current Quarter  Date  YTD Change + Current Year  Event Description Q  Earnings Call YTD Change + Bloomberg Estimates  Sales Current Quarter  Page  Current Year  Apple Thank you A  Timothy D Cook In terms India things mentioned correct Growing market like India result things well And it’s analogous years China It’s building stores It’s building channels It’s building markets It’s building developer ecosystem It’s having right product lineup market And I feel like we’re making good progress gaining understanding market long way go I sort opportunity instead problem And I feel great growth rate And that’s India I think it’s things As know I think talked before started manufacturing iPhone SE six months ago so And majority iPhone SEs sold domestic market quarter manufactured there And going hoping winds saving money time avoiding compounding taxes et cetera The bandwidth issue issue point out addressed large carriers Bharti Jio investing way are service India materially better  months ago So there’s sea change short period time So I feel good that long way go In terms monetization question ARVR tend focus foremost customer experience And we’re making sure experience great And think experience right revenues profits result getting right And we’re focused experience right now Q  Amit Daryanani I well I guess maybe start gross margins Luca yovery revenues going high single digits midpoint gross margin little Could tell puts takes that And yield inefficiencies broadly severe time vs you’ve seen historically A  Luca Maestri Yes Amit we’re guiding   That’s BPS sequentially Obviously we’re getting leverage larger volumes As I mentioned I think Toni higher cost structures time launch new products So going offset I mentioned particularly impact memory pricing environment headwind point Just size you impact memory gross margin BPS sequentially BPS yovery basis So meaningful impacts I think I think probably you’re referring to Q  Amit Daryanani Got it That’s helpful And I guess I follow Services line I mean guys talked fair earlier exclude onetime gain looks like half  accelerated BPS FY vs H  Qualitatively quantitatively way think expanding installed base things mentioned I think vs dollar iOS device see A  Luca Maestri Yes I think it’s both As I mentioned particularly App Store important us number paying accounts grown lot It’s grown lot because said installed base grown number changes easier customers world participate App Store able transact App Store We accepting example forms payment today  months ago  months ago So that’s important We typical spending curve customers When start transacting Store start certain level tend time familiar Store start spend more We’re now recently changes probably seen design App Store And I mentioning prepared remarks changes received favorably And people spending time Store download apps time translates monetization But businesses growing very fast actually accelerating I mentioned Music I mentioned iCloud adds up And correctly point out growth rate accelerating Company Name

For ASPs there’s element need consider As know newest products year higher ASPs past result reduce inventories newest products overall ASPs iPhone Q naturally decline sequentially higher percentage experienced historically So summary guidance iPhone we’ve got doubledigit yovery growth acceleration sellthrough growth yovery basis For balance company aggregate expect grow strong double digits yovery particularly strong performance service wearables like we’ve seen December quarter I hope helps Q  Kathryn Lynn Huberty Yes That’s great color Just follow gross margin guidance flat gross

happier rate pace developer community fast they’re developing new things And I don’t want do I happier things going right now Q  Antonio M Sacconaghi I question followup You commented installed base couple years grown  iPhone clearly largest component that And iPhone installed base probably growing close number less   Yet look iPhone unit growth FY sort what’s implied guidance FY FY it’s relatively flat So installed base that’s  plus higher unit growth that’s relatively flat suggest upgrade rate going down replacement cycle elongating And I’m wondering agree that investors worried that And maybe I add wrinkle potentially response is given consumers’ heightened awareness ability replace batteries going forward opposed upgrade isn’t investors potentially concerned terms impact upgrade rate going forward And believe not I follow up A  Timothy Donald Cook I think it’s investors things like focus on I don’t want position that The way I look this numbers you’ve quoted I different view them But generally iPhone reliability iPhone fantastic The second previously owned market expanded units years cases carriers retailers having vibrant programs trading iPhone in And iPhone largest residual rate it acts buffer customer buy new one winds customer perfectly fine having previously owned iPhone And I view incredibly positive It’s people iPhones better I like point major product hit high active installed base that’s iPad it’s Mac huge numbers well And we’ve said there’s large part vast majority services kind mapped installed base instead quarterly sales And

launching new markets world quarter broadening scope And course similar we’ve past years launched new services We’re looking launch new services going forward believe provide great value users we’re excited opportunities us I think you’re referring deceleration growth rate we’ve seen December quarter I think you’re referring growth reported September I think important point I need make I think it’s helpful asked question portion deceleration truly reclassification amortization free services we’ve connection adoption new revenue recognition standard And explained  days ago amortization free services past reported Products gets reported Services The reclassification actually dilutive growth rate amortization free services relatively stable number gets applied growing base reclassification reduces growth rate vs previous classification This factor represents roughly onethird deceleration you’ve seen We talked  growth September quarter With reclassification growth rate  explains deceleration There are I say factors explain difference   The foreign exchange plays role Roughly  Services business outside United States And know US dollar appreciated recent months And general tend reprice services foreign exchange frequent basis The second factor wellknown issue App Store China The App Store China large business us We believe issue approval new game titles temporary nature clearly affecting business right now And thirdly seen level deceleration AppleCare very strong growth FY we’re starting lap increase distribution coverage place recently channel Apple components happen increase distribution coverage But general very pleased  growth think business continue grow nicely going forward Q  Kathryn Lynn Huberty Just quick followup Luca share repurchases December quarter run rate June September quarters How weaker quarter play ability carry buyback level think right run rate going forward A  Luca Maestri We’ve said we’re committed executing program We B

results talk step capital return program traditionally spring Q  Steven Milunovich Some perception priced new products new iPhones high What learned price elasticity feel pushed envelope little bit far bring future A  Timothy Donald Cook If look past year priced iPhone XS US priced iPhone X year ago The iPhone XS Max new  XS And priced XR right middle entry iPhone  entry iPhone  Plus priced So there’s actually pretty small difference United States compared year However foreign exchange issue Luca spoke difference amplified difference international markets particular emerging markets tended significantly vs dollar And January locations products essentially absorb foreign currency compared year close right local price year ago So yes I think price factor I think FX piece And secondly markets I talked prepared remarks subsidy probably bigger issues developed markets I mentioned Japan country subsidy gone away period time you’re customer purchase S  cases  paid  it unbundled world it’s obviously that And working we’ve got number actions address that including tradein installment payments I mentioned well Q  Steven Milunovich I know you’re giving units going forward said qualitative comments I wondering comment particularly ASP yovery basis A  Luca Maestri We mention quarter different timing phone launches affect yovery compares If remember models XS XS Max shipped September quarter placed channel initial sales quarter year iPhone X shipped Q December quarter placed channel initial sales December quarter So knew create difficult compare Q  essentially happened It pretty line expectations To color I’d XR popular model it’s followed XS Max XS Q  Antonio M Sacconaghi It looks like midpoint Q revenue guidance implies steepest Q Q sequential decline iPhone revenues history It implies yovery deceleration iPhone revenues And I’m wondering comment that’s conservatism you’re entering quarter high level channel inventory maybe comment explicitly that actually think macroeconomic conditions getting worse A  Luca Maestri Three questions there The question conservatism As do provide range it’s range believe we’re going fall within We’ve pretty December quarter We didn’t miss years years that’s idea There isn’t specific level conservatism We believe range we’re going fall within On channel inventory know historical pattern iPhone channel inventory typically increase inventory Q decrease Q think year similar And we’ve exited December quarter levels inventory comfortable with So leaves reality iPhone performance Q revenue standpoint minus  And expected key factors Tim mentioned affecting iPhone performance Q Company Name Apple Market Cap  Bloomberg Estimates  EPS Company Ticker AAPL US Current PX  Current Quarter  Date  YTD Change  Current Year  Event Description Q  Earnings Call YTD Change  Bloomberg Estimates  Sales Current Quarter  Page  Current Year  effect Q starting strong US dollar environment On yovery basis negative impact currency going B that’s bit  points vs year’s revenue obviously plays role And macroeconomic environment particularly emerging markets continue there On positive side expect continue grow revenue nicely rest business iPhone Q  Antonio M Sacconaghi At September event Lisa Jackson Apple VP stated company needed “design products long possible” And Apple clearly helping battery replacement program iOS working older range products et cetera But I guess question doesn’t mean replacement upgrade cycles iPhones continue extend going forward that’s objectives And maybe end maybe help understand iPhones’ average replacement cycle today changed   years And again wouldn’t expect elongate time given aforementioned things Thank you A  Timothy Donald Cook We design products long possible Some people hold life product people trade in phone redistributed else doesn’t necessarily follow leads other The upgrade cycle extended There’s doubt that We’ve said times I think upgrades quarter anticipated reasons mentioned So goes future I don’t know I’m convinced making great product high quality best thing customer work user that’s way look it Q  Shannon S Cross I wanted ask trajectory Services gross margin BPS appears yovery You talked little bit sequential But what’s driving improvement volatile year depending quarters mix Just color start forecast this Thank you A  Luca Maestri You’ve seen Services gross margins increased yovery basis significant amount Let start sequential I think it’s probably relevant us Sequentially increased BPS It’s business growing nicely good support scale Some services scaling quickly tend expand gross margins there And favorable mix As probably know broad portfolio services Some tend accretive average gross margin services way account them For example know App Store book revenue net basis gross margins tend accretive But services successful average Services business And depending separate businesses marketplace we’re going seeing level movement going forward Services margins But you’ve seen  months they’ve gone nicely BPS sequentially they’ve gone BPS But I wouldn’t draw necessarily conclusion Services gross margin going time We report course end quarter it’s important mind it’s broad portfolio different gross margin profiles portfolio It important grow gross margin dollars And times grow services level gross margins average long good customer long generate gross margin dollars we’re going pleased Q  Shannon S Cross Can talk bit video You’ve signed myriad deals There announcement TV app directly Samsung comes you’ll multiplatform I’m curious view opportunity video And I guess assuming leverage costs you’ve already accretive margin I think Company Name Apple Market Cap  Bloomberg Estimates  EPS

people products better We think people going like that Another way course thirdparty video subscriptions store We participating today I guess that’s going accelerate future bundle breaks people begin buy likely multiple services place current cable bundle And finally original content participate original content world We signed multiyear partnership Oprah But today I’m ready extend conversation point We’ve hired great people I super confidence in they’re working hard And we’ll later Q  Walter Piecyk I question free services Can math works that Is free services noncash revenue that’s getting booked Services revenue cost costs come Products Can run current state vs accounting before A  Luca Maestri In essence sell product certain price assumption We estimate value associated providing free services In case it’s providing Maps services providing Siri providing free iCloud customers purchase product calculate estimated value That value gets deferred gets amortized estimated period time deliver free services In past deferral subsequent amortization reported Products Now connection new revenue recognition standard reclassifying essentially amortization Products revenue Services revenue So total revenue changed We report estimated value Services category We reclassify cost incur provide services So gross margin rate free services clearly significantly dilutive overall Services margin I hope I’ve helped that Q  Walter Piecyk It’s Services gross margin got it And second question think growth Services selling existing paid subscription customers it’s mm going B If talk high level far look growth going forward – mix terms selling existing users getting new users maybe individual services biggest growth opportunity Thank you A  Luca Maestri As I said essentially services installed base driver growing installed base The installed base grown nicely years We’ve added mm  months alone that’s step Then installed base course want sure people interested services addition transacting services free basis interested paying services And I mentioned percentage paid accounts increased strong double digits So want continue that We want easier customers actually use services accepting payment methods world And clearly said adding new services important us During years we’ve added Apple Pay incredibly successful it’s wonderful customer experience We’ve added Apple Music mm paid subscribers continues grow nicely And we’ve added useful service developers We provide advertising service developers App Store The way we’ve added services past obviously we’re

products value deliver We said time launch new products cost structures new products tend higher products replace Its inevitable We adding new technologies new features cost structures up We good track record taking cost structures life cycle product able bring down There lot elements gross margin line good control elements dont control Take example foreign exchange signiﬁcant headwind company
