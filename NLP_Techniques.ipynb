experience level cost pressure memory side particularly NAND DRAM To offset that actually better that good cost performance commodities And fact Services mix increases year course helping given profile gross margin Services So answers question Q2 As June quarter know tend level gross margin compression March quarter June quarter Again majority comes sequential loss leverage We different mix products June quarter cost pressures memory remain We expect offset partially impacts cost efficiencies again mix shift Services The impact NAND DRAM continue there expect there You know don’t guide past June quarter expect time being On Qualcomm I want very clear accruing We expect paying accruing right now So didn’t benefit PL margins March quarter we’re getting benefit June quarter either Q

grew 21 acceleration seen previous quarter And traffic – incredibly important retail stores lot sell – traffic 27 year year And seven highest traffic stores world Greater China And that’s set things went direction speak On flip side currency devalued 5 that’s insignificant headwind And performance continued weak Hong Kong hit bit harder tourism market continues slump Also iPhone 7 Plus well didn’t perform previous generation iPhones And that’s set things plus minus side We perform I thought would At I thought similar previous quarter was What I believe we’ll improve bit current quarter

interesting One nineyear low iPhone purchase intent cycle And declining retention rate US 80 Any comment you’re concerned A  Timothy Donald Cook I glanced it I haven’t time study it But general seeing we’re seeing believe pause purchases iPhone believe earlier frequent reports future iPhones And clearly going on what’s data I don’t know seeing transparency Q  AM Sacconaghi Jr I well First Tim I’m wondering comment recent decision rationale withholding royalty payments Qualcomm And specifically I wonder believe risk Qualcomm detrimental response withholding modem chip sales potentially getting injunction iPhones select geographies world And I’d like understand perspective real risk degree And Apple potentially risks advance arguably significant largest product launch history A  Timothy Donald Cook Anyone standardsessential patent responsibility offer like called FRAND terms FRAND stands fair reasonable nondiscriminatory terms That’s price business terms Qualcomm offer Apple And I don’t believe – I don’t believe going decide enjoin iPhone based that I think there’s plenty case law subject shall see In terms we’re withholding royalties can’t pay there’s dispute amount You don’t know pay And think owe amount think owe different amount hasn’t meeting minds there And point need courts decide that Unless able to time settle amount right we’re depending courts that And thinking The reason we’re pursuing Qualcomm’s trying charge Apple percentage total iPhone value And great work standardsessential patents it’s small iPhone is It’s – display Touch ID gazillion innovations Apple done And don’t think that’s right we’re taking principled stand it And strongly believe we’re right I’m sure believe are And that’s courts for And we’ll let that Q  AM Sacconaghi Jr I wondering I follow little bit iPhone demand If I try adjust drawdown inventory extra week quarter I think sequentially iPhones declined 27 I adjustments And that’s actually bit lower normal seasonality Q1 Q2 typically closer 20 I understand comments China comparison 40 points easier quarter relative quarter And growth rate improved marginally I think adjust extra week And final comment pause iPhones So

17 compared FY2015 84 previous year So look 2014 2016 revenue grew 52 CAGR 23 pretty good result Also probably know FY2016 performance hurt devaluation currency affected 3 underlying business performance 14 down And so down There’s lots reasons largest view look happened 2015 China surge upgraders came market iPhone 6 iPhone 6 Plus upgrade rate increased relatively Greater China world And upgrade rate FY2016 returned normal upgrade rate akin saw iPhone 5S point fall And that’s main reason view difference Now spun created issue us didn’t forecast accurately So Q1 year channel inventory resetting channel inventory quarters came came it And issues main second symptom it views main issue Now looking forward response iPhone 7 7 Plus positive It’s hard gauge demand know you’re selling

issues channel inventory build timing launch I stand terrific new products major competitors laying down enormous significant contribution extra week arguably 7 8 iPhone growth sort flattish investors think iPhone sustained basis growing forward And reasonable think ongoing growing business company A  Luca Maestri Toni let one I think mentioned number things affecting December quarter I went Katy minutes ago You’re right we’ve got extra days You know launch timing different You know increased iPhone channel inventory 33mm units year ago I mentioned issues affect us onetimer year ago obviously need exclude compare FX reality business right now But maybe important element fact supply constrained 7 7 Plus And talk competitors it’s particularly relevant right selling produce And look things totality think total company course believe revenue’s going grow You know don’t specific product unit standpoint giving guidance feel confident trajectory company iPhone going forward Q  Antonio M Sacconaghi Okay Tim I ask one please You’ve talked past television area intense interest I wondering reaffirm statement Is case And additionally given what’s happening acquisitions broadly think role content Apple started creating limited scale content think content creation ownership important Apple Apple ultimately sees place value chain ecosystem distribution A  Timothy Donald Cook I confirm television intense people here In terms owning content creating content started focusing original content point out Weve got things going weve talked about And I think it’s great opportunity creation point view ownership point view it’s area we’re focused on Q  Simona K Jankowski I question Luca Tim well Luca I wanted dig Services business bit more As pointed out accelerated 24 How compare pace growth installed base help decouple consumption driven user basis vs base whole A  Luca Maestri Simona installed base number talk periodically The time talked it January call It growing Our installed base growing well important us It’s growing major products it’s growing course total When look Services revenue growth Services revenue accelerating course year period when know revenue came slightly

Page 11 Current Year 226936190 And guys obviously Siri well But I curious think balancing AI focus privacy And important dedicated home assistant vs having phone home assistant A  Timothy Donald Cook I think answer second question first I think people like assistant time And live mobile society People constantly moving home work things doing And advantage having assistant phone it’s time That doesn’t nice market home one I’m making point I’m saying balance point view I think usage phone likely greater In fact look Siri today accelerating iOS 10 Mac we’ve getting 2B requests week Siri And it’s large best knowledge we’ve shipped assistant enabled devices probably there Our focus worldwide it’s US focus want deliver great experience world deliver globally weve lot energy that In terms balance privacy AI long conversation high level I think it’s false tradeoff people like believe privacy order AI you We don’t buy that It different kind work It thinking I don’t think throw privacy away It’s sort like ageold argument privacy vs security We both It shouldn’t making choice And high level it Q  Steven M Milunovich Luca I wanted ask total deferred revenue 13B June I think 400mm September Those large declines given fact units coming accounting change September Could talk drivers expect going forward A  Luca Maestri Steve mentioned far largest driver The largest driver fact change accounting change ESPs exactly year ago So lapping year effect I think you’re going thing going forward And tend defer revenue categories like example gift cards AppleCare general far largest element change ESPs And again I don’t think you’re going impact going forward Q  Steven M Milunovich Okay Thank you And then Tim investors antsy Apple acquired new profit pools introduced financially material new product recent years The question is A Apple today grand strategy want do I know won’t tell us know want maybe years Or read market quickly react And B sense we’re kind gap period

it But usual we’re going talk what’s ahead Q  Steven M Milunovich But terms approach I guess new products strong sense technology going you’re going play Or year willing react fairly quickly arguably organization allows size company are A  Timothy Donald Cook We strong sense things we’re agile shift need to Q  Wamsi Mohan So Tim Luca saw raise ASP iPhone 7 Plus 20 you’re completely sold out So clearly device plays central role lives owners probably look incremental cost great tradeoff best device there So features added iPhones conceptually expect close point raising ASPs net disruptive

iPhone 7 And mix projected iPhone 7 Plus short reality chasing supply there In terms ASP way think want charge fair price don’t want charge that think it’s worth fair And that’s look it A  Luca Maestri If I add Wamsi mind lot countries world reality customers seen significant price increases FX situation right And that’s need mind well Q  Wamsi Mohan Great Thanks Thanks clarification And Tim year saw carrier incentives come force post launch iPhone 7 7 Plus Two years ago giant upgrade iPhone iPhone 6 6 Plus Do think couple years likely carrier incentives come play given worries customer churn making phone affordable Thanks A  Timothy Donald Cook We clearly saw year There’s lot competition customers US I think market you’re talking about Whether that’ll happen years I don’t know But I suspect time large numbers customers phone that’s year kind range tends sweet spot I think probably lot people trying recruit customers Q  James D Suva A strategy question Tim financial question Luca Tim you’d mentioned prepared comments little bit India we’ve lot work talking opportunity India And lot pushback talking disposable income metrics lots things like that population large talk little bit about India point big opportunity China And appears legal rules kind prevented going lot looks like that’s changing Can kind little clarity India And then Tim clarification questions fair OpEx disproportionate expense 14th week kind think maybe forward shouldnt expect OpEx kind chugging high rate Or kind rate investing you’re going Thank much gentlemen A  Timothy Donald Cook Yeah thanks question I’ll let Luca talk OpEx piece it On India I think it’s important look capita income you’re looking at sort look number people middle class sort decade And age population look India 50 population 25 And very young population The smartphone India general However key reasons infrastructure hasn’t there But year year year enormous investments going 4G couldn’t excited takes great network working iPhone produce great experience people And I lot factors moving right direction there I think government focused infrastructure creating jobs fantastic need kind infrastructure technology that Will big China I think it’s clear population India exceed China probably decade so maybe that I think longer GDP rival it that’s critical great success there The truth is there’s going lot people lot people middle class want smartphone I think compete percentage those And given starting point we’ve growing lot lot headroom mind working hard realize opportunity 14Company Name Apple

think critical invest So significant investments RD You’ve seen growth rates couple years We making important investments data centers want support services business We continue open retail stores world We continue invest marketing advertising At time want continue efficient lean It’s we’ve years want continue that So you’ve seen example FY2016 you’ve seen investments RD growing 25 SGA expenses flat And kind approach want continue going forward If step second look implied guidance December quarter got expense revenue ratio 9 This extremely competitive industry I general And want continue balance right investments remain efficient Q  Rod B Hall I Luca followup Tim So Luca I wanted ask gross margin guidance I think Street expecting little bit higher And again that’s 50BPS lower Street I think 70BPS lower And I’m curious think people mismodeling going pricing mix provide color on So that’s question A  Luca Maestri Yeah Rod let sequential basis I’ll yovery basis maybe that’s disconnect comes from looking year’s gross margins December quarter On sequential basis essentially guiding improvement gross margins We 38 June quarter September quarter We’re guiding slightly higher December quarter positive we’re going course better leverage mix December quarter tends better But need account fact positives going partially offset cost structures new products launching weve launched September quarter impact December quarter results On yovery basis mind year did Q1 40 40 40 41 theres couple things I think need considered yovery compare And it’s fact year award patent infringement 548mm That is gross margin level 40BPS And we’ve got FX situation I mentioned before worth 60BPS 70BPS And you’re left 100BPS deterioration yovery basis again reality new cost structures products It very important I think investors understand what’s happened years During years US dollar appreciated 15 basket currencies business And we’re company generates thirds revenues outside United States 15 appreciation US dollar So yovery basis 2016 2015 340BPS impact foreign exchange This offset entirely number initiatives going pricing actions cost initiatives hedging program point strong dollar new normal need work that And I think years good tradeoffs gross margins stable time Q  Rod B Hall Okay Great Thanks Luca And then Tim I wanted ask you question comes while I wanted ask talk little bit arguments sides dividend question I mean Apple perpetually undervalued It’s large company It’s getting harder harder grow Your payout ratio significantly SP 500 I know can’t tell intentions here help understand thinking dividend works great A  Timothy Donald Cook We review capital return annually we’ve established cadence announce thinking April And robust discussion dividend buyback We believe

alltime record quarter And look constant currency basis actually 6 So it’s significantly better performance way look vs experienced prior quarters Underneath that we’ve seen iPhone 7 bestselling smartphone China quarter according Kantar Singles Day huge day China know popular US brand Alibaba We set new record Services China company did And Mac revenue double digit yovery iPad units double digit Mainland China obviously different trend saw balance world We saw 50 iPhone sales China switchers firsttime buyers high number we’re pleased with And obviously total installed base continues

aggregate Services business tends margins company average They accretive help bit margin standpoint Within Services business different margin profiles because know account services different ways In cases transact buysell basis In cases perform agents example developers drives different margin percentages Q  Shannon S Cross Thank you And followup terms elasticity demand moves currency perspective I think past concern emerging markets basically able – weren’t you’re getting volumes raise ASPs given currency But talked lot emerging markets actually pretty quarter So I’m curious You raised price iPhone 7 Plus that What seeing customers saying terms willingness pay up A  Luca Maestri Shannon I looking back Since June 2014 we’re talking 25 years ago dollar strengthened 25 basket currencies business And obviously difficult situation us I’ve mentioned foreign exchange significant headwind us revenue level gross margin level In emerging markets it’s incredible The level products continues phenomenal The brand continues aspirational There people afford products world The middle class growing places like China India Brazil certainly strong dollar doesn’t help us And therefore pricing decisions need careful We want optimal balance units revenue margin difficult dollar appreciates Q  Brian J White Luca I’m wondering talk little bit gross margins Sales obviously beat high end revenue range It looks like gross margin dead middle Can talk puts takes gross margins quarter please A  Luca Maestri Sure We actually high end range gross margins We guided 38 385 came 385 exactly And really slight improvement midpoint guidance range fact revenue ahead expectations got bit leverage increased revenue levels We felt good gross margins quarter Again mind strong dollar doesn’t help front Q  Brian J White Okay And Tim I didn’t hear mentioned India How India perform iPhone And think 2017 especially 4G network going up A  Timothy Donald Cook That’s good question Despite demonetization India created lots economic pressure quarter despite that alltime record revenue results happy that The demonetization impact worked way yet It’s definitely having overhang But I think longer term it’s great move I feel good we’re there We discussions number things including retail stores fully intend invest significantly country believe it’s great place be Q  Simona K Jankowski I wanted dig little bit iPhone upside quarter record revenues region Greater China I think touched percent switchers China But little color split upgrades switchers regions overall well A  Timothy Donald Cook Simona it’s Tim We exceptional quarter iPhone backdrop predicting demand iPhone 7 Plus constraint quarter If look absolute number upgraders highest we’ve seen quarter And look switcher number it’s highest we’ve seen quarter If look upgrade rate it’s similar year However I think big asterisk – I share transparency’s sake I tell way look quarter supply constraint it’s difficult draw conclusions it But I wanted share backdrop 14Company Name Apple Inc Market Cap 63803597 Bloomberg Estimates  EPS Company Ticker AAPL US Current PX 12135 Current Quarter 2086 Date 20170131 YTD Change +553 Current Year 8887 Event

comps easier year I curious think you’re going returning growth region And context I know talked 6 constant currency increase revenue Mainland China But curious strip doubledigit increase iPad MacBook potentially mix shift iPhone 7 Plus I’m curious underlying iPhone units Mainland China A  Timothy Donald Cook That’s big question I don’t answer me If look iPhone 7 Plus popular Plus model we’ve had It set unit record I share In terms going do don’t provide guidance segment level But sitting today Q2 I wouldn’t expect yovery performance dramatically different yovery performance Q1 The real comp begins following quarter significant degree we’ll plays closer it Q  Antonio M Sacconaghi I wanted better understand upgrade rate dynamics So I think iPhone units sellthrough basis 8 You extra week gave 8 I understand differences timing launch So making adjustments looks like iPhone units probably low single digits But Luca alluded fact install base growing double digits So suggest upgrade rate upgrade percentage actually declining And specifically I’d like broader perspective investors think upgrade rates It looked like peaked iPhone 6 cycle looks like they’ve extending – going lower Replacement cycles extending couple years I think US carriers alluded well So I’m wondering step talk little bit broadly investors think trajectory years investors think going forward Do believe opportunities upgrade rate improve replacement cycles accelerate going forward And considerations think about A  Luca Maestri I think it’s good question number points I want make Starting growth install base iPhones yes it’s growing strong double digits that’s good number reasons including fact it’s big driver Services business When look geographically I think different developments For example felt very good unit growth markets world You’ve quoting overall total company growth rate But look countryspecific level lot countries I majority countries iPhone units grew strong double digits starting United States example fact annual upgrade programs popular proving positive us Same happened number countries world starting Canada Australia places Western Europe well Japan grew double digits terms units So I think geographically seeing very good performance The point I think I need think upgrade rates clearly issue strong dollar doesn’t help us Could sell significantly significantly faster upgrade cycle standpoint places outside United States we’ve forced increase prices 20 30 40 certain countries And think impact having local demand obviously doesn’t help us But overall I Tim said look upgrade rate look standpoint new phones right new generation phones upgrade rate percentage people upgraded new phone similar we’ve seen year The 6 cycle certainly phenomenal cycle There pentup demand larger screen phones And certainly look ahead role play The we’re able innovate new generations products clearly plays role upgrade rate Q  Antonio M Sacconaghi Okay thank you Tim I question you Back April 2012 said earnings calls I’ve hated litigation I continue hate it I highly prefer settle vs battle Yet recently decided initiate lawsuit Qualcomm I’m wondering

confirm there’s potential gross margin risk future result litigation A  Timothy Donald Cook I feel way I April 2012 I don’t like litigation view resort And filing viewed didn’t way forward They insisting charging royalties technologies with And situation innovated unique features like Touch ID advanced displays cameras few money Qualcomm collect reason expensive innovate And it’s somewhat like buying sofa charge somebody different price depending price house goes into Just point view doesn’t sense don’t believe pass muster courts In addition that increasingly radical steps taking try hold model withheld 1B payments owed us And felt like choice net it In terms goes we’ll see I don’t like litigation And there’s way great point I don’t it I fully expect point time time end I think common sense prevail courts is And that’s way I it Thanks question Q  Steven M Milunovich First I wanted ask iPad It looked like turn possibly positive You said plan I think pretty Street’s expectations And ASP deteriorated pretty significantly I don’t know it’s mix shift But maybe talk iPad going forward A  Timothy Donald Cook The iPad Steve 16 millionunit swing channel inventory years In yearago quarter increased 900000 In quarter decreased 700000 On ASP point view yearago quarter launched iPad Pro 13 Edge That iPad obviously highest price it We channel plus launch product bolstered ASPs particular quarter In addition that undercall number iPads demand quarter compounded shortage issue suppliers And all things going there If I zoom 90day clock look it we’ve got exciting

customer sat numbers roof Literally customer sat iPad Pro 99 It’s stunning And I lot good things hope better results currently shortage issue now I’m projecting totally quarter And damper quarter somewhat But again 90day clock I’m bullish iPad Q  Steven M Milunovich Okay that’s great thank you And then Tim investors tend think iPhone mature technology improvements incremental I believe said there’s plenty runway left terms appealing new features Do think future enhancements coming viewed material users particularly changes form factor way phone looks Are functional things coming time

bit question Tim You talked bit providing lot value Apple sets prices according value And I think given uniqueness product iPhone X particular makes lot sense I guess question given uniqueness value marketplace shouldn’t – we shouldn’t expect gross margins improve cycle vs previous ones And talk little bit think pricing context gross margin And I followup please A  Luca Maestri Toni I’ll one When – said price products value deliver We said time launch new products cost structures new products tend higher products replace It’s inevitable We adding new technologies new features cost structures up We good track record taking cost structures life cycle product able bring down There lot elements gross margin line good control elements don’t control Take example foreign exchange significant headwind company years now Also mix products sell market tends change time impact overall gross margin company There situations commodities markets good shape There situations commodity markets bit balance We case right memory pricing headwind time being So there’s puts takes The fact Services business growing positive Services margins tend accretive company margins So there’s puts takes We tend think maximizing gross margin dollars think that’s important thing investors end day When look track record years I think we’ve good balance unit grow gross margins revenue continue forward Q  Antonio M Sacconaghi Okay Thank that And I wanted revisit notion supply demand I realize it’s early can’t predictions I think common investor question is iPhone X available sale It quickly pushed availability levels unprecedented levels vs history And I think significant question is initial pushout function uniquely strong demand vs history pushout availability function weaker supply vs history So it’d helpful You past commented 24hour orders 4mm plus iPhone 6 6 Plus You talked targeting think reach supplydemand balance So it’d helpful provide context terms know initial orders supplies vs history

I think it’s things As know I think talked before started manufacturing iPhone SE six months ago so And majority iPhone SEs sold domestic market quarter manufactured there And going hoping winds saving money time avoiding compounding taxes et cetera The bandwidth issue issue point out addressed large carriers Bharti Jio investing way are service India materially better 12 months ago So there’s sea change short period time So I feel good that long way go In terms monetization question ARVR tend focus foremost customer experience And we’re making sure experience great And think

quarter I think you’re referring growth reported September I think important point I need make I think it’s helpful asked question portion deceleration truly reclassification amortization free services we’ve connection adoption new revenue recognition standard And explained 90 days ago amortization free services past reported Products gets reported Services The reclassification actually dilutive growth rate amortization free services relatively stable number gets applied growing base reclassification reduces growth rate vs previous classification This factor represents roughly onethird deceleration you’ve seen We talked 27 growth September quarter With reclassification growth rate 245 explains deceleration There are I say factors explain difference 245 19 The foreign exchange plays role Roughly 60 Services business outside United States And know US dollar appreciated recent months And general tend reprice services foreign exchange frequent basis The second factor wellknown issue App Store China The App Store China large business us We believe issue approval new game titles temporary nature clearly affecting business right now And thirdly seen level deceleration AppleCare very strong growth FY2018 we’re starting lap increase distribution coverage place recently channel Apple components happen increase distribution coverage But general very

little bit far bring future A  Timothy Donald Cook If look past year priced iPhone XS US priced iPhone X year ago The iPhone XS Max new 100 XS And priced XR right middle entry iPhone 8 entry iPhone 8 Plus priced So there’s actually pretty small difference United States compared year However foreign exchange issue Luca spoke difference amplified difference international markets particular emerging markets tended significantly vs dollar And January locations products essentially absorb foreign currency compared year close right local price year ago So yes I think price factor I think FX piece And secondly markets I talked prepared remarks subsidy probably bigger issues developed markets I mentioned Japan country subsidy gone away period time you’re customer purchase 6S 6 cases 7 paid 199 it unbundled world it’s obviously that And working we’ve got number actions address that including tradein installment payments I mentioned well Q  Steven Milunovich I know you’re giving units going forward said qualitative comments I wondering comment particularly ASP yovery basis A  Luca Maestri We mention quarter different timing phone launches affect yovery compares If remember models XS XS Max shipped September quarter placed channel initial sales quarter year iPhone X shipped Q1 December quarter placed channel initial sales December quarter So knew create difficult compare Q1 2019 essentially happened It pretty line expectations To color I’d XR popular model it’s followed XS Max XS Q  Antonio M Sacconaghi It looks like midpoint Q2 revenue guidance implies steepest Q1 Q2 sequential decline iPhone revenues history It implies yovery deceleration iPhone revenues And I’m wondering comment that’s conservatism you’re entering quarter high level channel inventory maybe comment explicitly that actually think macroeconomic conditions getting worse A  Luca Maestri Three questions there The question conservatism As do provide range it’s range believe we’re going fall within We’ve pretty December quarter We didn’t miss years years that’s idea There isn’t specific level conservatism We believe range we’re going fall within On channel inventory know historical pattern iPhone channel inventory typically increase inventory Q1 decrease Q2 think year similar And we’ve exited December quarter levels inventory comfortable with So leaves reality iPhone performance Q1 revenue standpoint minus 15 And expected key factors Tim mentioned affecting iPhone performance Q1 16Company Name Apple Market Cap 73160593 Bloomberg Estimates  EPS Company Ticker AAPL US Current

Current Year 258686564 effect Q2 starting strong US dollar environment On yovery basis negative impact currency going 13B that’s bit 2 points vs year’s revenue obviously plays role And macroeconomic environment particularly emerging markets continue there On positive side expect continue grow revenue nicely rest business iPhone Q  Antonio M Sacconaghi At September event Lisa Jackson Apple VP stated company needed “design products long possible” And Apple clearly helping battery replacement program iOS working older range products et cetera But I guess question doesn’t mean replacement upgrade cycles iPhones continue extend going forward that’s objectives And maybe end maybe help understand iPhones’ average replacement cycle today changed 3 5 years And again wouldn’t expect elongate time given aforementioned things Thank you A  Timothy Donald Cook We design products long possible Some people hold life product people trade in phone redistributed else doesn’t necessarily follow leads other The upgrade cycle extended There’s doubt that We’ve said times I think upgrades quarter anticipated reasons mentioned So goes future I don’t know I’m convinced making great product high quality best thing customer work user that’s way look it Q  Shannon S Cross I wanted ask trajectory Services gross margin 500BPS appears yovery You talked little bit sequential But what’s driving improvement volatile year depending quarters mix Just color start forecast this Thank you A  Luca Maestri You’ve seen Services gross margins increased yovery basis significant amount Let start sequential I think it’s probably relevant us Sequentially increased 170BPS It’s business growing nicely good support scale Some services scaling quickly tend expand gross margins there And favorable mix As probably know broad portfolio services Some tend accretive average gross margin services way account them For example know App Store book revenue net basis gross margins tend accretive But services successful average Services business And depending separate businesses marketplace we’re going seeing level movement going forward Services margins But you’ve seen 12 months they’ve gone nicely 450BPS sequentially they’ve gone 170BPS But I wouldn’t draw necessarily conclusion Services gross margin going time We report course end quarter it’s important mind it’s broad portfolio different gross margin profiles portfolio It important grow gross margin dollars And times grow services level gross margins average long good customer long generate gross margin dollars we’re going pleased Q  Shannon S Cross Can talk bit video You’ve signed myriad deals There announcement TV app directly Samsung comes you’ll multiplatform I’m curious view opportunity video And I guess assuming

Apple TV you’re familiar product The second way AirPlay 2 have As pointed out support number different thirdparty TVs we’re excited that It makes experience living room people products better We think

place current cable bundle And finally original content participate original content world We signed multiyear partnership Oprah But today I’m ready extend conversation point We’ve hired great people I super confidence in they’re working hard And we’ll later Q  Walter Piecyk I question free services Can math works that Is free services noncash revenue that’s getting booked Services revenue cost costs come Products Can run current state vs accounting before A  Luca Maestri In essence sell product certain price assumption We estimate value associated providing free services In case it’s providing Maps services providing Siri providing free iCloud customers purchase product calculate estimated value That value gets deferred gets amortized estimated period time deliver free services In past deferral subsequent amortization reported Products Now connection new revenue recognition standard reclassifying essentially amortization Products revenue Services revenue So total revenue changed We report estimated value Services category We reclassify cost incur provide services So gross margin rate free services clearly significantly dilutive overall Services margin I hope I’ve helped that Q  Walter Piecyk It’s Services gross margin got it And second question think growth Services selling existing paid subscription customers it’s 300mm going 05B If talk high level far look growth going forward – mix terms selling existing users getting new users maybe individual services biggest growth opportunity Thank you A  Luca Maestri As I said essentially services installed base driver growing installed base The installed base grown nicely years We’ve added 100mm 12 months alone that’s step Then installed base course want sure people interested services addition transacting services free basis interested paying services And I mentioned percentage paid accounts increased strong double digits So want continue that We want easier customers actually use services accepting payment methods world And clearly said adding new services important us During years we’ve added Apple Pay incredibly successful it’s wonderful customer experience We’ve added Apple Music 50mm paid subscribers continues grow nicely And we’ve added useful service developers We provide advertising service developers App Store The way we’ve added services past obviously we’re interested adding new
